## Summary
* **Async actions with middleware (react thunk)**
* Reoganize an action creator with **thunk**
* Create an action creator which calls others action creator

* Rule of redux-thunk: Actions creator can return:
    * **An action object** that must include **"type"** property (**"payload"** property is optional)
    * **A JS function** that react thunk will automatically invoke this function, with redux-thunk we can use **async-await** syntax no problem whatsoever

### App goals:
* Absolutely understand the purpose of **reducers**
* Absolutely understand the purpose of **connect** function and **Provider**
* Absolutely understand **making API requests with Redux**
* Absolutely understand the purpose of **redux-thunk**
